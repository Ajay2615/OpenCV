# Projective transformation using OpenCV


A projective transformation is a transformation used in projective geometry: it is the composition of a pair of perspective projections. It describes what happens to the perceived positions of observed objects when the point of view of the observer changes.

OUTPUT:

We can see that AC remote is tilted a bit and we can see some of the info of the remote even though the info on original image is not clear.
